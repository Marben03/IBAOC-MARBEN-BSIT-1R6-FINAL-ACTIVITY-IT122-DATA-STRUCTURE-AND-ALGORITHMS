    "#9 Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph is a pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links. The interconnected objects are represented by points termed as vertices, and the links that connect the vertices are called edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "graphs can be represented in data structure. We can represent a graph using an array of vertices and a two-dimensional array of edges. Before we proceed further, let's familiarize ourselves with some important terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vertex − Each node of the graph is represented as a vertex. In the following example, the labeled circle represents vertices. Thus, A to G are vertices.\n",
    "Edge − Edge represents a path between two vertices or a line between two vertices.\n",
    "Adjacency − Two node or vertices are adjacent if they are connected to each other through an edge.\n",
    "Path − Path represents a sequence of edges between the two vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "basic primary operations of a Graph:\n",
    "    Add Vertex − Adds a vertex to the graph.\n",
    "    Add Edge − Adds an edge between the two vertices of the graph.\n",
    "    Display Vertex − Displays a vertex of the graph.\n",

    "#10 Binary Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search is a fast search algorithm with run-time complexity of Ο(log n). This search algorithm works on the principle of divide and conquer. For this algorithm to work properly, the data collection should be in the sorted form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search looks for a particular item by comparing the middle most item of the collection. If a match occurs, then the index of item is returned. If the middle item is greater than the item, then the item is searched in the sub-array to the left of the middle item. Otherwise, the item is searched for in the sub-array to the right of the middle item. This process continues on the sub-array as well until the size of the subarray reduces to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a binary search to work, it is mandatory for the target array to be sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "#11 Bubble Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of Ο(n2) where n is the number of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "We observe in algorithm that Bubble Sort compares each pair of array element unless the whole array is completely sorted in an ascending order. This may cause a few complexity issues like what if the array needs no more swapping as all the elements are already ascending.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ease-out the issue, we use one flag variable swapped which will help us see if any swap has happened or not. If no swap has occurred, i.e. the array requires no more processing to be sorted, it will come out of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "#12 Quick Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick Sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm and is based on partitioning of array of data into smaller arrays. A large array is partitioned into two arrays one of which holds values smaller than the specified value, say pivot, based on which the partition is made and another array holds values greater than the pivot value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quicksort partitions an array and then calls itself recursively twice to sort the two resulting subarrays. This algorithm is quite efficient for large-sized data sets as its average and worst-case complexity are O(n2), respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pivot value divides the list into two parts. And recursively, we find the pivot for each sub-lists until all lists contains only one element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using pivot algorithm recursively, we end up with smaller possible partitions. Each partition is then processed for quick sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "#13 Insertion Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm. Here, a sub-list is maintained which is always sorted. For example, the lower part of an array is maintained to be sorted. An element which is to be 'insert'ed in this sorted sub-list, has to find its appropriate place and then it has to be inserted there. Hence the name, insertion sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "The array is searched sequentially and unsorted items are moved and inserted into the sorted sub-list (in the same array). This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of Ο(n2), where n is the number of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insertion sort compares the first two elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#14 Merge Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge Sort is a sorting technique based on divide and conquer technique. With worst-case time complexity being Ο(n log n), it is one of the most respected algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge sort first divides the array into equal halves and then combines them in a sorted manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that merge sort first divides the whole array iteratively into equal halves unless the atomic values are achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge sort keeps on dividing the list into equal halves until it can no more be divided. By definition, if it is only one element in the list, it is sorted. Then, merge sort combines the smaller sorted lists keeping the new list sorted too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge sort works with recursion and we shall see our implementation in the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#15 Shell Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "is a highly efficient sorting algorithm and is based on insertion sort algorithm. This algorithm avoids large shifts as in case of insertion sort, if the smaller value is to the far right and has to be moved to the far left.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm uses insertion sort on a widely spread elements, first to sort them and then sorts the less widely spaced elements. This spacing is termed as interval. This interval is calculated based on Knuth's formula\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is quite efficient for medium-sized data sets as its average and worst-case complexity of this algorithm depends on the gap sequence the best known is Ο(n), where n is the number of items. And the worst case space complexity is O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "#16 Selection Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Selection work is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm in which the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and swapped with the leftmost element, and that element becomes a part of the sorted array. This process continues moving unsorted array boundary by one element to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexities are of Ο(n2), where n is the number of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "#17 Simple Explanation of Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "Is the process which comes into existence when a function calls a copy of itself to work on a smaller problem. Any function which calls itself is called recursive function, and such function calls are called recursive calls. ... In the following example, recursion is used to calculate the factorial of a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is the process of defining a problem (or the solution to a problem) in terms of (a simpler version of) itself. For example, we can define the operation \"find your way home\" as: If you are at home, stop moving. Take one step toward home.\n",
